            Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks<br>
            associated with  creating, building, and maintaining websites and web<br>
            applications that run online on a browser. HTML (HyperText Markup <br>
            Language) is the standard markup language used in web development to <br>
            create the structure and content of web pages. It's the foundation of<br>
            most websites, allowing developers to structure content into elements<br>
            like paragraphs, headings, images, links, lists, and more .<br>
